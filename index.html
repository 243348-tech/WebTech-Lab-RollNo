            <h3>Short Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I am a passionate student currently exploring the world of web technologies and version control. 
                This lab task is helping me understand how professional developers collaborate using GitHub. 
                I enjoy solving logical problems and building structured layouts using HTML and CSS. 
                My goal for this semester is to master the fundamentals of full-stack development. 
                In my free time, I like to stay updated with the latest tech trends and practice coding challenges. 
                I believe that consistent practice is the key to becoming a proficient software engineer.
